# SDCardLocation
Ubersicht widget to visually see where the SD card slot is on an iMac

Do you have an iMac with both the CD/DVD slot and the SD card slot? Have you ever accidentily put an SD
card into the DVD slow and had to fish it out? I've done it more than 1 time so I created a widget to 
visually indicate where the SD card slot is. 

This very simple widget will show a small vertical bar on the right-hand side of the screen where the SD
slot is located so that you can align the SD card to be inserted with the correct slot without having to 
look around to the side of the iMac.

Setup:
1) You will need to modify the "top" and "right" values according to your screen size and resolution. The 
default values of "top: 770px" and "right: -12px" is fine for my 2048x1152 screen size.
2) Adjust the color and opacity of the indicator bar in the background-color tag. The default uses a
red bar at 0.4% opacity.
